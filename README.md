Intelligent curricula and adaptive tutoring

This project uses the FrameNet semantic frame network and the SNePS knowledge representation, reasoning and acting software to create an intelligent curriculum, a knowledge base that represents the knowledge associated with a particular curriculum.

The latest version of SNePS is used - Concurrent SNePS, or CSNePS, which is written in the Clojure programming language.

Using a frame-based approach, both declarative and procedural knowledge can be modelled. The procedural knowledge is used to create an adaptive tutoring agent.

The initial deliverable from the project is a knowledge base that represents the GCE A-level Chemistry curriculum.
