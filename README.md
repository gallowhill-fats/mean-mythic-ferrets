# mean-mythic-ferrets
The main software deliverable of the Mean Mythic Ferrets (MMF) project is a teaching and learning application that is based on the representation of an academic curriculum by a semantic frame network expressed in a knowledge representation, reasoning and acting system.

The major features of the application are as follows.

The design is underpinned by a novel frame-based pedagogy that models both declarative and procedural knowledge.

The semantic frames in the underlying model are taken from the FrameNet project.

A curricular semantic frame network is represented by a knowledge base in the CSNePS knowledge representation, reasoning and acting system.

The application can be used as a curriculum modelling tool, an intelligent tutor or an adaptive tutoring system.

The application is modelled as a cognitive agent capable of reasoning and acting through an implementation of the SNePS Modular Grounded Layered Architecture with Integrated Reasoning (MGLAIR) adjunct.

The application is written in Clojure, the language of CSNePS.
